# Resizeable Panes

"Resizeable Panes" was a small jQuery project done at my stint at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/). The image displays Hubble's sharpest view of the Orion Nebula.

## Tech

HTML, CSS, jQuery

## Features

-   Users can drag the bar on mousedown to reveal more of a color version of a bw photo of the Orion Nebula.

-   The moment the user releases the mouse, the bar jumps back to the initial middle position.

## Goals while doing the project

-   Learning a basic UI feature using `mousedown`, `mousemove` and `mouseup` event handlers in jQuery.
